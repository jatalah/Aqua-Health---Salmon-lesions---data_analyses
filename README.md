# Aqua Health - Salmon biofouling challenges

This repository contains data and scripts used for the Biofouling challenge trials conducted in Ruakaka and the FRC facility, as part of the AquaHealth programme.

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of this move to in situ net cleaning on skin health of farmed stock. Tank-based challenge trials were conducted to investigate the effect of exposure to simulated net cleaning waste material on smolt and adult Chinook salmon. This included characterisation of biofouling communities growing on farm nets and the bacterial load associated with cleaning debris.

This repository contains data and scripts used for the Biofouling challenge trials conducted in Ruakaka and the FRC facility, as part of the AquaHealth programme. 

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of this move to in situ net cleaning on skin health of farmed stock. Tank-based challenge trials were conducted to investigate the effect of exposure to simulated net cleaning waste material on smolt and adult Chinook salmon. This included characterisation of biofouling communities growing on farm nets and the bacterial load associated with cleaning debris. Increased knowledge of the potential effects of net cleaning can inform optimal cleaning strategies that promote stock welfare and drive profitability.
